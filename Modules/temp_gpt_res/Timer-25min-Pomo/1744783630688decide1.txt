system:
You are a professor with in-depth knowledge of User Interface (UI) tasks. You are assigned a specific UI task, a history operation sequence, and the current UI (which is the result of the last action).
Your task is to evaluate if the operation sequence and the current UI can further lead to the user task fulfillment. You should categorize the STATUS as:
1,completed: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the user's task is completed;
2,wrong: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is not correct and the current UI cannot further lead to the UI task anymore (You should choose "wrong" if you think navigating back is necessary to finish the task).
3,go on: After the Latest action and the subsequent newest UI screen, the Last Action is on the correct track, which means the agent can continue to perform further operations (excluding navigating back) to complete the task. Further Actions should be taken on the current (may also be the subsequent pages) UI page.
Use the following steps to respond. Fully restate each step number before proceeding. i.e. "Step 1".
Step 1:Reason step-by-step about the the history ACTIONs (especially the last action leading to the Current UI)and UI TASK. Whether Last Action can contribute to fulfill the user's task IN THE LONG RUN?
Step 2:Reason step-by-step about whether LATEST UI PAGE can further lead to the UI task fulfillment IN THE LONG RUN. Can any element on screen be operated next to lead to the fulfillment of the task?
Step 3:Reason step-by-step about whether there are any elements with GENERAL proposes that are worthy being explored. If any, you should also choose "go on" and explore them. A kind note: if you find <scroll /> elements, it means that you can try to scroll forward to explore more elements on the screen. so you can also choose "go on" if you think there are elements worthy being explored.
Step 4:Synthesize the above thoughts and output a conclusion on the STATUS as a JSON object structured like:
Hint:
1, if the history operation sequence actually indicates the completion, should consider "completed", i.e. Last step clicking OK may lead to completion
{
    "next ui element": if the value of the status is "go on", please also output the next ui element to be operated. The status should not be "go on" if none element in the UI page can be the next.
    "status": "completed" or "wrong" or "go on". Attention that only when "next ui element" refers to a valid element on the screen can you choose "go on"
    "reason": reason for the decision,
}.

Task:Set a timer for 25 minutes and label it 'Pomodoro'
Last Action:
NOTE in this History Pages and Action Dict format:
1, Here "Page_X"  means each page UI elements that the user has gone through.
2, Here "Action_x_to_y"  means the action which operated on x and leads to y.

([] means it's empty in the latest page and cannot go on)


===response===
Step 1: The last action in the sequence was "Click on 'Clock' enabled clickable Clock," which took the user from the app list to the clock app. This action is correct in the context of setting a timer, as it navigates to the clock application where timer functions are typically found.

Step 2: The latest UI page shows options for "Alarm," "Clock," "Timer," and "Stopwatch," with "Timer" being a clickable element. Clicking on "Timer" is the appropriate next step to set a timer, aligning with the task of setting a 25-minute timer.

Step 3: The UI page contains several clickable elements, including "Timer," which is directly relevant to the task. There are no additional general-purpose elements like a scroll that need to be explored further, as the "Timer" element is clearly identified as the next actionable step.

Step 4: Based on the analysis, the task is not yet completed, but the user is on the correct path. The next action should be to click on the "Timer" element to proceed with setting a 25-minute timer.

```json
{
    "next ui element": "Timer",
    "status": "go on",
    "reason": "The user has navigated to the clock app, and the 'Timer' option is available and clickable on the current UI page, which is the correct path to set a timer."
}
